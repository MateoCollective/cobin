    "description": "This class will explore the creative plasticity of exposure and development of black and white negative films using Minor White's famous Zone System Manual (1956). The first day is lecture/presentation format; the remaining time will be spent in darkroom. Students are expected to expose one role of film before the second class. Students will photograph subject material using the full range of aperture and shutter speeds under various lighting conditions. We will then develop the films to achieve a wide variety of exposure scales revealing the effects of exposure upon development, and vice-versa. The second part of the class will explore soft and hard developers. Specifically, we will explore the expressive properties using straight Metol and Metol -Hydroquinone developers, in varying proportions, developed with a grade 2 paper. Students must supply one roll of Black and White film and a 35mm camera with manual exposure. It is recommended you bring the camera to the first class. The chemistry will be supplied.

This course will take the student on an experiential journey of self-discovery and artistic development through a wide variety of creative arts including music, movement, theatre, voice, visual arts and writing. We will be using mindfulness, along with an Expressive Arts framework, in order to allow the creative pulse that lives in all of us to begin to flow. The Expressive Arts is a low-skill high-sensitivity model of artistic development where we focus on process rather than product and make time to respond to each others art work in a way that is supportive and sensitive. Not only can the arts bring joy to our lives and deepen an understanding our own identities, but they can also help us to cope with a wide range of lifeâs challenges from low self-esteem, stress management, to making positive changes in our lives. By tapping into our curiosities and allowing ourselves to be guided by the present moment, students are invited to engage in an exploratory process that is uniquely enriched and enlivened by the exposure to a variety of art forms. This course is open to both newly developing artists and experienced artists who want to explore unfamiliar art forms. No previous art experience is required, only curiosity and an openness to play.

    "description": "University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Seminar Series 2015-16 Lauren Notini, Fellow, Clinical and Organizational Bioethics, University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics will present on Incidental Findings in Bioethics: A Challenge for Practicing Healthcare Ethicists This event will also be webcast: https://jcb.adobeconnect.com/bioethicsseminars/ In the clinical context, incidental findings are defined as previously unnoticed findings that are revealed unexpectedly by a diagnostic test or examination and are not related to the reason(s) the test or examination was requested. Healthcare professionals may deliberate about the best way to manage incidental findings, including whether and how to disclose incidental findings to the affected individual(s). Since incidental findings may have significant and far-reaching medical, financial, social, and/or psychological consequences for the individual(s) concerned, practicing healthcare ethicists (PHEs) may be called upon to assist in these deliberations. Although there is a significant amount of literature on incidental findings and how they should be managed in the clinical context, little attention has been paid to incidental findings that PHEs may encounter in their own professional practice. In this seminar, I will use de-identified case examples to highlight some different ways that incidental findings may emerge in the work of a PHE. I will draw similarities and dissimilarities between incidental findings in the clinical and bioethics contexts and consider whether any findings can truly be considered âincidentalâ in bioethics. I will also explore different ways in which PHEs may manage incidental findings that arise in their practice and highlight the ethical pros and cons of each of these approaches. I propose that it would be worthwhile for PHEs and ethics programs to consider how they will manage incidental findings that may emerge in their practice, if they have not done so already.",

In the pediatric cancer context, decision making about the fertility preservation is challenging, in part, because parents must serve as proxy decision makers for their children. Despite guidelines stipulating that children be involved in medical decision making to the extent dictated by their capacities, children's involvement in fertility preservation discussions and procedures is controversial. Some adults worry that children who are involved in decision making about fertility preservation are at risk of “sexualization” because of these discussions involve information about sexual health and reproduction. Using a feminist relational lens, I examine the nature and scope of this so-called risk of sexualization. I argue that the perceived risk of sexualization actually represents two separate ethical concerns, namely concerns about children’s (present) sexual agency and concerns about children’s (present and future) reproductive agency. I maintain that concerns about sexual agency should not be a barrier to children’s involvement in fertility preservation decision making, however, concerns about children’s reproductive agency in the context of fertility preservation warrant further examination.",

At the same time these budding filmmakers do not necessarily understand the essential grammar upon which all movies are based. This class is for educators wishing to teach movie-making exercises in their own classrooms, exercises designed to impart the fundamental grammar required by their students. Participants will work in small groups to perform several hands-on shooting and editing exercises. Participants can leave the workshop with up to three completed shooting exercises in hand. Please bring a USB memory stick with at least 500MB of free space to class each day to facilitate taking your work home. Equipment Note: Each exercise has a hands-on digital editing component. Students will share a small number of computers using Adobe Premiere editing software. The editing portion is less about the software and more about evaluating the shooting component. The same principles will apply regardless of the editing system used. The cameras used in this class are very simple: it's not about the camera it's about what is happening in front of the camera. Non-educators needing some practical hands-on experience will also benefit from this class. NOTE: Deadline to withdraw or transfer from this class is 5pm Aug 26. A $15 withdrawal fee applies.",

Combining formal lecture, reading and analysis of example plays, in-class creative writing exercises, and workshopping of participants' writing, we'll explore dramatic situation, conflict, character, dialogue, and plot, and share strategies for creating written work that can function as the basis for a performance by actors. Particular focus will be given to shorter forms like the 10 Minute Play and the One Act, as these commonly feature in contests and festivals for student and emerging playwrights, and are often used by more experienced writers to develop material and explore ideas for longer plays. Please note that an integral part of the course after the first session will be the reading and workshopping of participants' work, so you should be prepared to devote a few hours to writing during the weeks between our meetings. The class is geared toward beginning writers, and will be structured so that everyone who participates fully and completes all suggested writing exercises will finish with at least one completed 10 Minute Play.\"Instructor: Justin Blum NOTE: Deadline to withdraw or transfer from this class is 5:00 pm on May 24.
